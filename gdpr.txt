'We' or 'Us' or `Our` (ChillBot Development Team)

This privacy policy will explain how ChillBot uses any personal data we collect from you when you use ChillBot.

What data do we collect?
	ChillBot collects the following data:
		> Discord username and ID (e.g. "HurleybirdJr#5000")
		> User-submitted data (such as SoundCloud URLs, Discord CDN media URLs¹)
		> ChillSynth Discord server booster status
		> ChillSynth Discord thread and channel IDs that you are included/have sent related data in

How will we use, collect and store your data?
	All data is collected and processed via ChillBot using the Discord API and stored in a private and authenticated
	MongoDB instance. Access to this data is limited to only ChillBot and `Us` via authentication keys that 'We' hold securely.

	Any user-submitted data is publicly accessible via the ChillSynth discord in public channels that both the user and
	other members can access as this is what the Discord API can access and in extension, ChillBot and 'Us'.

	We will use your data for any and all activities in the ChillSynth Discord server as this is the only platform that
	ChillBot can interact with. We will refuse to store/process any identifiable data, even through user-submitted means.

	Your data will be kept up to 60 days or less. If your data is no longer relevant/expires after 60 days
	(e.g. you leave the server, you exercise your GDPR rights, etc...), than all data we've collected from you will be deleted automatically from ChillBot.

What are your data protection rights?
	'We' would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your GDPR rights and your freedom to exercise these.

	**The Right To Access**
		You have the right to freely request `Us` for copies of all of your data.

	**The Right To Rectification**
		You have the right to freely request that `We` correct any information you believe is inaccurate without any dispute.
		Additionally, you also have the right to freely request `Us` to complete information you believe is incomplete without any dispute.

	**The Right To Erasure**
		You have the right to freely request that `We` erase and delete your data within certain conditions.

	**The Right To Restrict Processing**
		You have the right to freely request that `We` restrict the processing of your data within certain conditions.

	**The Right To Object To Processing**
		You have the right to freely object to `Our` processing of your data within certain conditions.

	**The Right TO Data Portability**
		You have the right to freely request that `We` transfer the data that we have collected from you to another
		group/organization, or directly to you within certain conditions.

Privacy policies of other services:

	`We` keep this privacy policy updated and will update this policy when required. Any updates will be posted to the
	#announcements channel in the ChillSynth Discord server and dated here. This privacy policy was last updated on 14 January 2023.
